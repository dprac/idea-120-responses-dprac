# <h2> Inclusiveness and Diversity in Game Development  </h2>

<p>One of Anna Anthropy's major arguements for why games and game development need to be more inclusive is that the lack of diverse voices  
continues to perpetuate games made for and by a single demographic: white, young males. The environment for professional game  
development is driven by a loop that rewards games that attract major sales, markets to gamers that will continue to support these games,  
and hires developers who are were drawn towards work by these same games. It isn't unreasonable to say that this cycle produces  
games that are not only interative but also highly limiting. I don't think, for instance, that the entirity of the visual arts could  
just be summed up by the art of sculptors in togas, and in a similar sense I also don't believe the entirity of what gaming can   
offer starts and ends with first-person shooters.</p>

<p> When more people are able to use the tools of game development, new forms of expression or new ways to interate on existing genres   
can be created. I personally enjoy role playing games, particularly the Persona and Fire Emblem games. While I think these types of games  
are interesting and enjoyable, I acknowledge that they are limited with regards to the kinds of stories they tell. Games of this genre   
still lack LGBTIA+ representation, and unfortunately wither due to cultural or developer biases, such representation may not happen.  
I think it is important for games to include and tell these perspectives as it reflects a signifigantly larger audience, and it also can   
introduce players new persepectives. I also think inclusiveness in game development helps bring about a wider scope of human experiences to   
the fold--take for instance games such as This War of Mine, which places gamers in a war setting that isn't just window dressing for a power fantasy.   
With how vastly derviative and morally bankrupt major game development has shown itself to be, I think that there can truly only be good to come from   
sharing the tools of game development to individuals and indie developers.</p>
