# <h2> Inclusiveness and Diversity in Game Development  </h2>

<p>One of Anna Anthropy's major arguements for why games and game development need to be more inclusive is that the lack of diverse voices  
continues to perpetuate games made for and by a single demographic: white, young males. The environment for professional game  
development is driven by a loop that rewards games that attract major sales, markets to gamers that will continue to support these games,  
and hires developers who are were drawn towards work by these same games. It isn't unreasonable to say that this cycle produces  
games that are not only interative but also highly limiting. I don't think, for instance, that the entirity of the visual arts could  
just be summed up by the art of sculptors in togas, and in a similar sense I also don't believe the entirity of what gaming can   
offer starts and ends with first-person shooters.</p>
