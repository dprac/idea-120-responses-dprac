# <h2> Bad Statistics and WMDs  </h2>

<p> Data, while not inherently harmful, can be used with malicious intent. One prevalent example that Mona Chalabi noted in her TedTalk was   
the dubious reporting of and publication of private poll data. When neither journalists nor companies have an ethical concern to accurately   
record statistics, it can lead to some harmful and misleading interpretations. While I think I personally have a good amount of media literacy,   
I would not consider myself entirely immune. Such statistics are prone to be read at face value, and this is only made worse when the   
methods of data collection are intentionally skewed.</p>

<p>Another point of issue with data brought about by Cathy O'Neil is how data collection itself can have blindspots, biases, or implicit values.  
The impact O'Neil says this plays on law enforcement (or the lack of law enforcement) is palpable even in the familar streets of Chicago,  
where both percieved safety and anxiety correlate directly with police prescence. While these aspects of targeted data application are harmful, it is  
undeniable that the mundane aspects of data use, such as the previlence of cookies, is not only vital but also neccesary when it comes to the opperational use of the internet   
itself. </p>
