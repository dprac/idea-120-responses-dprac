# <h2> Barthes and Reading Images 

<p>There are three types of messages Barthes believes images convey:  
They are lingistic, denoted, and connoted. </p>

<p> The first is based upon the lingustic imformation of the image,  
while the later two are based on what can be visually read explicitly  
versus what is impled. </p>

<p> The image attached above was found on Twitter. The image  
itself features lingistic messages on the image as well as   
the Tumblr reblog. The text on the image can be read in any  
order, and it conveys the interpreted elements of the image.  
The text of the reblog from user "noblepeasant" is a   
response to the image and the text. </p>

<p> The image itself denotes a scene featuring a man, a baby, and a woman.  
The man is in robes and holding a baby, while a beam of light is projected upon  
the woman on the ground. Even without the captons directly on the image,   
the man can be assumed to be Jesus due to his iconigraphy; long flowing hair, beard,  
and robes. </p>

<p> There are many connotations at play from both the image and the reblog text.   
The image and the reblog text from user "noblepeasant" assume the   
audience will believe the image to be absurd. What "noblepeasant" has written  
is to be read, in the same manner as the image, as a joke. </p>

<p> This image is clearly a screencapture from Tumblr, and it has been  
spreed to Twitter in a form close to its original context. This same image  
could be shared without including the content from the reblog, and a user  
on Twitter or Instagram can choose to comment on the picture their own way.  
They may even just copy the line directly from the reblog, however,  
that would be looked down upon as an act of "stealing the joke". </p>
