# <h2> Murray and The Future  </h2>

<p> I believe Murray was exceptionally accurate in her predictions regarding the synthesis of the internet and television.   
The access to the internet via "WebTVs" has been a relatity for at least the past decade.  If there was one trend that Murray   
failed to predict, it would be the impact smartphones have had on both media production and consumption. The internet   
is not just tied to the televison or home; it is a part of a virtual ecosystem that includes phones and personal devices.  
Apps have effectively replaced the utility of television channels, and access to media via apps like Netflix allow shows and movies   
to be accessed with any device capable of an internet connection. </p>

<p> There is a level of immersion that livestreaming and interactive online performance has that Murray imagined in this chapter;  
I think the imagined aspect of being able to interact with the character on screen or showrunner as an audience member is more   
tangable than it was in the time of Murray's writting. The aspect of Murray discussing visiting virtual or simulated worlds is   
facinating in the sense that it has been applied back into the production of traditional filmmaking via forms such as the virtual  
set technology used in the Mandolorian.</p>

<p> There are at least three levels of reality within the production of a show like The Mandolorian. The first level is experienced by   
the actors, whom perform in a space that simulates a location. They act around a projection. The second level of reality is  
experienced by the production team, whom capture the actors acting in front of the projection. The last level of reality is experienced by the audience,  
who consume the resulting footage through the context of a narrative. They experience the footage not as actors in front of a screen  
but as characters in a different planet or setting. </p>
