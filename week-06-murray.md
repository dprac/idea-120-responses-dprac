# <h2> Murray and The Future  </h2>

<p> I believe Murray was exceptionally accurate in her predictions regarding the synthesis of the internet and television.   
The access to the internet via "WebTVs" has been a relatity for at least the past decade.  If there was one trend that Murray   
failed to predict, it would be the impact smartphones have had on both media production and consumption. The internet   
is not just tied to the televison or home; it is a part of a virtual ecosystem that includes phones and personal devices.  
Apps have effectively replaced the utility of television channels, and access to media via apps like Netflix allow shows and movies   
to be accessed with any device capable of an internet connection. </p>
